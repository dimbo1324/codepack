"""Making console output survive whatever encoding the terminal happens to use.

Every script in this repository printed a heading through ``console.heading`` before it
did any work, and every one of those headings contains an em dash. On the default code
page of a Russian ``cmd.exe`` (cp866) that single character raises ``UnicodeEncodeError``
and the script dies before reaching its first real step — a tool that cannot run at all
on the platform the product targets.

Cyrillic itself was never the problem: cp866 and cp1251 both encode it. The whole crash
came from two typographic characters the copy happens to use, ``—`` and ``→``.

Two rules, and the split between them is the point:

* **A terminal keeps its own encoding**, and unencodable characters degrade to an ASCII
  equivalent. Forcing UTF-8 bytes at a cp866 console would replace a crash with mojibake,
  which is not obviously better — whereas ``--`` instead of ``—`` costs a reader nothing.
* **A redirected stream is switched to UTF-8.** A file or a pipe is a byte sink with no
  rendering opinion, so the typographic character survives, and a CI job whose locale is
  ASCII gets readable Russian instead of a page of question marks.

The console code page is deliberately **not** modified. ``SetConsoleOutputCP`` outlives
the process and would leave the user's terminal changed after a script they ran once.
