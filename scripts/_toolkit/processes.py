#: Tools that are not a plain executable on Windows. npm-installed CLIs land as
#: ``<name>.CMD`` shims, and ``CreateProcess`` only ever appends ``.exe`` when resolving
#: a bare name — so a bare "pnpm" is reported as missing on a machine that has it. This
#: exact bug was live in ``cargo xtask doctor`` until 2026-07-26.
#:
#: The bare-name case is handled by the ``shutil.which`` call that runs first, so it is
#: not repeated here — an empty entry in this tuple was skipped by the loop and only
#: looked like coverage it did not provide.
_WINDOWS_SHIM_SUFFIXES = (".cmd", ".bat", ".exe")

#: Seconds a *captured* command may take before it is abandoned. Capturing means the
#: caller is waiting on output it intends to parse, so a tool that never answers hangs
#: the script with no sign of why. The classic on Windows is the Store's ``python``
#: stub, which opens a shop window and never returns.
#:
#: Streaming commands (``run``) deliberately have no timeout: those are builds and test
#: suites, where "slow" is normal and the user can see progress and interrupt.
DEFAULT_CAPTURE_TIMEOUT = 30.0

#: Synthetic exit codes, following the shell conventions so they are not mistaken for a
#: tool's own. 127 is "command not found" everywhere; 124 is what GNU ``timeout`` returns.
