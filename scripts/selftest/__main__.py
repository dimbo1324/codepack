"""Check that the developer scripts themselves still work.

Two things, both cheap: the stdlib unit tests under ``scripts/`` (which cover
clean-project's protected-path rules, the one piece of logic here that can destroy
data), and a load of the orchestrator catalog, which fails loudly on any bad hand-edit
of the JSON.

Worth running after touching anything in ``scripts/`` — a broken catalog or a weakened
protection rule is invisible until the moment it matters.
