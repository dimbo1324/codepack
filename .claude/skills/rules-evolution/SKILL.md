# Evolving the Agent Rules

The rule set is a living system. Keeping it accurate is part of the work, not overhead.
The full protocol is `.ai/universal/08-rules-evolution.md`; this skill is the operational
path.

## The prime safeguard

**Never weaken a rule to make your current task easier.** If a rule blocks you and you
believe it is wrong, stop, report the conflict, and propose the change. Do not edit and
proceed.

## 1. Decide whether a change is required

A change is **mandatory** when: a rule is factually false (stale command, path, or crate
name); the same friction cost you time twice; reviews keep finding the same class of
defect; the owner gave an instruction that constrains future work; the workflow changed;
or following a rule produced a worse outcome.

## 2. Decide whether you may do it alone

**Autonomous** — making rules more accurate or clearer: fixing a stale path or command,
resolving a contradiction against the code, clarifying misleading wording, adding an
example, adding a constraint the owner just stated.

**Needs owner approval** — anything that loosens the system: removing a rule, relaxing a
constraint, threshold, gate, or invariant, changing the definition of done, the branch
or publish policy, the language policy, or the documentation policy.

When in doubt, ask.

## 3. Apply the change

```powershell
# 1. Edit exactly one concern in .ai/universal/ or .ai/project/
# 2. Add an entry to .ai/CHANGELOG.md: date, what, why, who decided
# 3. Regenerate the compiled Codex entry point
cargo xtask sync-agents

# 4. Verify it is in sync and within budget
cargo xtask sync-agents --check
```

Universal modules stay portable — no project names, paths, or stack specifics. If the
change touches per-assistant workspaces, mirror it in `.claude/` and `.codex/` in the
same task.

Commit the module, the changelog entry, and the regenerated `AGENTS.md` **together**.

## 4. If the size budget blocks you

The compiled `AGENTS.md` must stay under 30 KiB. If sync fails, either tighten the
module or mark a situational module with `<!-- tier: extended -->` and give it an
`> **Essence.**` line right after its title. Extended rules remain binding; only their
full text moves out of the compiled file.

## 5. Retiring a rule

Obsolete rules are deleted, not commented out — git history is the archive. Deletion
needs owner approval, a changelog entry explaining why, and a check that no other module
still references it.

## Review cadence

At the end of every task, fix anything the task proved stale. At the end of every stage,
re-read the project modules against the code — commands, layout, and gates drift most.
Rule problems you cannot fix now go into the final report, and, if significant, into
`docs/__arch__/open-questions.md`.
